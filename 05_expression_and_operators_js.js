var a = 2;
var b = "2";
console.log("\t\t\t\t\t -- COMPARISON OPERATOR -- ");
console.log("a==b: ",a==b);//It will return true because it forget to compare data-type of both varaible ONLY CHECK VALUE
console.log("a!=b: ",a!=b);//It will return False because it forget to compare data-type of both varaible ONLY CHECK VALUE
console.log("a===b: ",a===b); // This Will Return False because it will compare data-type also!
console.log("a!==b: ",a!==b); // This will Return True because they have different data-type but value is same.
